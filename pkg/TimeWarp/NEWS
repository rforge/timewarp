                CHANGES in TimeWarp version 1.0-1 (2011-12-18)
CHANGES
    o   Removed the default 'bizdays' for argument 'by' in
        dateWarp() - the argument 'by' must be specified if
	it is needed.
    o   All functions that manipulate dates are now generic so
    	that they return the same class of object as they are
	given: character, Date, POSIXct, and POSIXlt.
