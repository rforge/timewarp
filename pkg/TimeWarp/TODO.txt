- check that don't have this problem where as.Date() is used inside dateAlign() and dateShift()
        # To get as.Date() to behave sensibly, need to explicitly
        # supply tz to as.Date().  Otherwise we get the behavior
        # where as.Date(as.POSIXct('2011-12-10 19:55:26 EST', tz='EST'))
        # returns '2011-12-11' (the next day)
	# Note that as.Date(as.POSIXct('2011-12-10 19:55:26')) also returns the next day
	# as.Date(as.POSIXlt('2011-12-10 19:55:26'), tz='EST') returns the same day

- add tests for parsing dateWarp() list components like 'N bizdays@HOLIDAYS'
- make TimeWarp work with date/times:
    make the base function for dateAlign/dateShift use POSIXlt (it already does this inside the function, after converting to Date)

- make dateWarp able to take a list of specs and do aligns
  as well as shifts (get examples/tests from the S-PLUS
  bmc.misc library files bizdaySeq.html, warp.html. (Lots of
  these tests should already be in there.)

  When given a list of shifts and aligns, dateWarp should use
  the function arguments as defaults -- values should not
  propogate from one shift/align to the next.  E.g., with this
  spec:
    dateWarp('2014-05-01', holidays="NONE", list(shift=list("2 bizdays", holidays="JPNEX"), shift=list("2 bizdays")))
  the second shift should use holidays="NONE", not holidays="JPNEX".
