- add help file for dateAlign

- make dateAlign work with vectors

- add tests for dateAlign

- check whether using week.align in dateAlign requires also
  by="weeks" - if this is the case (I think it is), consider
  a warning if week.align is supplied and by != "weeks"

- finish the "orig.class" and format stuff for dateParse
  (idea is that dateAlign and dateWarp should return an
  object of the same class as their argument -- e.g., if
  given a character vector, it should return a character
  vector, if given a Date vector, they should return a Date
  vector, if given POSIXct, should return POSIXct, etc -- in
  the internals will probably want to use POSIXct or Date,
  so use "orig.class" to record the desired class of the
  output)

- make various functions use orig.class

- make dateWarp able to take a list of specs and do aligns
  as well as shifts (get examples/tests from the S-PLUS
  bmc.misc library files bizdaySeq.html, warp.html. (Lots of
  these tests should already be in there.)

  When given a list of shifts and aligns, dateWarp should use
  the function arguments as defaults -- values should not
  propogate from one shift/align to the next.  E.g., with this
  spec:
    timeWarp(x, holidays="NONE",
             list(shift=list("2 bizdays", holidays="JPNEX"),
                  shift=list("2 bizdays")))
  the second shift should use holidays="NONE", not holidays="JPNEX".
